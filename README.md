A short screencast, which shows the features in action: [http://www.screenr.com/w877](http://www.screenr.com/w877).

How to install:

1. Install [the latest version](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html) of Intellij IDEA (both Ultimate and Community are suitable).

2. Add `scala.macro.debug.enabled=true` to idea.properties in the IDEA's install dir.

3. Install Scala plugin stable build from the GUI (`Settings -> Plugins`). If you are familiar with IDEA you can install the nightly build.

4. Clone this repository and open it in IDEA.

5. If you don't have IDEA's JDK configured (e.g. if you didn't use it before), open the `Project Structure` menu and create JDK for Java 1.6. // Need a link about how to do that!

6. Everything's set up - now you can try out the debugger!
