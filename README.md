A short screencast, which shows the features in action: [http://www.screenr.com/w877](http://www.screenr.com/w877).

###How to install:###

1. Install [the latest version](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html) of Intellij IDEA (both Ultimate and Community editions work with the macro debugger).

2. Add `scala.macro.debug.enabled=true` to `idea.properties` in the IDEA's install dir.

3. Install the Scala plugin using `Settings -> Plugins`. Macro debugger is bundled with the official Scala plugin for IDEA, so you don't need to download additional software.

4. Clone this repository and open it in IDEA.

5. If you've not yet configured JDK 1.6 in IDEA, [do that](http://www.google.com/).

6. Everything's set up - now you can compile the demo project, set some breakpoints and try out the debugger!
